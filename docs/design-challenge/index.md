# Design Challenges

Design Challenges are at the core of what makes DDS Special. Design Challenges are an amazing way to step outside of your modeling comfort zone, and compete against others in a mutually beneficial way.

## Scoring
Each Design Challenge will net a total of 7 points maximum, with 4 for completion and 3 possible bonuses. **Late submissions** will allow participants to win up to 2 completion points and all 3 bonus points. 

### Bonuses
- Simplicity bonus: Awarded to submissions that simplify design and make the rest of their teams life easier
- Quality bonus: Awarded to submissions that embody good design principles and reflect the time and effort put into making a design as clean as possible.
- Special bonus: Bonus point specific to each design challenge, usually involving the way the challenge is approached and the design is executed. 

### Leaderboards

Design challenges will feature two separate leaderboards: **Beginner** and **Intermediate/Advanced**. Each leaderboard will function independently, but points will be transferred when beginner members gain experience and self identify as intermediate. PLEASE DO NOT SMURF!!! DDS is meant to be a community for learning, and trying to game the system by identifying as a beginner only discourages others. If we believe someone is trying to smurf, they will be spoken to and potentially warned of their behavior.
