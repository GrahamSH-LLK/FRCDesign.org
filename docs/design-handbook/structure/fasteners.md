# Fastener Standards

A guide on fasteners and fastener standards common in FRC. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes for various different applications and use cases. At there core, they are used to attach 2 or more parts together in order to contruct your robot. 

## Fasteners in CAD

### Why?

Putting all of your fasteners in your CAD is very important for a few reasons.

## Bolts and Nuts

### Types of Bolts

Socket Head Cap Bolt

Button Head Bolt

Flathead/Countersunk Bolt

Shoulder Bolt

### Types of Nuts

Nylock Nuts

Low Profile Nylock Nuts

Rivnuts

Heat Set Inserts

Tee Nut?

Wing Nut?

### Imperial Bolt Sizes

\#4-40

\#6-32

\#8-32

\#10-32

1/4-20

!!! Important
    Modern FRC generally uses two different types of imperial bolts, #10-32 and 1/4-20. FRC COTS components primarily utilize 10-32 fasteners, and with a bit of effort, we can make robots that use almost exclusively #10-32 hardware. In general:

    - \#10-32 is used for almost everything: retaining shafts, screwing into motors, superstructure, etc.
    - 1/4-20 is used for structural applications where more strength is required than #10 can provide. 

### Metric Bolt Sizes
While most of modern FRC is imperial, there are still a few components that use metric hardware to mount.

When designing around hardware, it is best to use the **[hole tool](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/hole.htm)**

- \#10-32 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.196 inches** for a standard fit
- 1/4-20 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.257 inches** for a standard fit
