# Fastener Standards

A guide on fasteners and fastener standards common in FRC. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes for various different applications and use cases. At there core, they are used to attach 2 or more parts together in order to contruct your robot. 

## Fasteners in CAD

### Why?

Putting all of your fasteners in your CAD is **very important** for a few reasons. Putting hardware in your CAD lets you check clearences between parts, have an accurate BOM so you know exactly what you need to order, and it makes it easy for your team to assemble the robot. 

### Best Practices

Before we get into the different types of fasteners, we must first talk about CAD best practices. Putting your fasteners into the document in the wrong way can and will lag your document. 

Standard Content - Onshape has a feature called "Standard Content" that has a wide variety of fasteners ready to import and be used in your assemblies. 

McMaster Carr - Sometimes, the Standard Content tab will not have the exact size or type of fastener that you need. This is where we go to the next best thing: McMasterCarr. McMaster has every single type of fastener you can think of. The best thing? Every single one has their own CAD file, free to download. So, when you have a time where the fastener you need isn't in Standard Content? Go to McMaster, download the file you need, and you will be back on track. 

Replicate Tool - You only need to import each unique size of fastener per assembly. After, use the extremely useful "Replicate" tool to copy that piece of hardware into every place you need it to be. This massively reduces load times and cleans up your assemblies significantly, making it easier for you and others to navigate your CAD.

## Bolts and Nuts

### Types of Bolts

Socket Head Cap Bolt

Button Head Bolt

Flathead/Countersunk Bolt

Shoulder Bolt

### Types of Nuts

Nylock Nuts

Low Profile Nylock Nuts

Rivnuts

Heat Set Inserts

Tee Nut?

Wing Nut?

### Imperial Bolt Sizes

\#4-40

\#6-32

\#8-32

\#10-32

1/4-20

!!! Important
    Modern FRC generally uses two different types of imperial bolts, #10-32 and 1/4-20. FRC COTS components primarily utilize 10-32 fasteners, and with a bit of effort, we can make robots that use almost exclusively #10-32 hardware. In general:

    - \#10-32 is used for almost everything: retaining shafts, screwing into motors, superstructure, etc.
    - 1/4-20 is used for structural applications where more strength is required than #10 can provide. 

### Metric Bolt Sizes
While most of modern FRC is imperial, there are still a few components that use metric hardware to mount.

M4

M5

M6


When designing around hardware, it is best to use the **[hole tool](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/hole.htm)**

- \#10-32 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.196 inches** for a standard fit
- 1/4-20 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.257 inches** for a standard fit
