# Best CAD Practices
This is a living document. The goal is to record the "Best" CAD practices so that it is easier to stay up to date and compare your CAD practices with what's "standard" 

# Document Setup
The current "best" setup is a multi-document setup that references each other. 

- Master Sketch 
    - This is your master geometry 
- Main Document

- Subassembly 1 

- Subassembly 2

- Subassembly 3 (repeat as necessary)

*Example of Multi Document Setup*


# Sub Document Setup

Within Each Document, you should have a part studio and assembly attached to it. The goal is to have only 1 part studio and 1 assembly, although depending on your load times you may want to split (such as camera mounts).

Note how there's only 1 part studio and 1 assembly. 

# Master Sketch Practices
Utilize Layering to prevent confusing, have a sketch for each mechanism if possible. 

Utilize colored sketches to define subassemblies 
# Feature Tree Practices

Derive applicable master sketches into part studio
Derive Applicable 

# Assembly Practices
